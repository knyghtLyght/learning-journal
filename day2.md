# Day 2
tired

stomach is also not playing nice. new diet needs work

class is good. Speed is good. Went home about 130 to get the home environment setup. Good practice for Git.

Something is wrong with the way I'm linking css in my about me lab. The code looks exactly the same as the demo and my path seems right. It linkd from inside VSCode but it won't display any of the stling in the browser. Not even the reset. Will ask in slack. 

Link was fine but I misspelled the ruleset so it didn't look how I expected it too. Problem solved. 

## Learned today:
- Link CSS in the head of your page
- Link Javascript at the bottom of your body tag
- Your main html file should be index.html
    - sub sites can have any name as long as they are relevent
    - style.css is a good standard
    - app.js is a good standard
- Multiple files for each language is called a seperation of concerns
- html is structure, CSS is style, and javascript is functionality
- A statment is anythign that ends in a ;
- Repl.it and Codepen.io can help you see what your code is doing in real time
- == is loosly equals or has type coercion (should not be used)
- === is strictly equals and should be used for comperison
- parseInt() will covert a string number into a number data type
- When linking that path is reletive to the index.html file
- Overview of psuecode
- Arrays
    - designated with []
    - considered a data structure
    - can contain multiple data types but should only contain one
    - Array elements can be assinged at creation or afterword with array[0] =
    - Methods()
        - array.length returns number of elements
        - array.forEach() loops through the array
        - array.push() add to end of the array
        - array.pop() remove from end of array and return the element value
        - array.unshift() add to the start of the array
        - array.shift remove from the start of the array and return the value
- Git
    - git add *filename*
    - git add . (adds all in directory)
    - git commit -m (commits added files with a message)
    - git push origin master (git push *location* *branch* uploads commit to target repo)
- Linter is the config for the intelisense and editor error catching.
